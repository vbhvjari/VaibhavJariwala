1. Inventories: list of all nodes 
- static  :
- dynamic :

2. Modules: piece of code/command/unit of code
> ping to other machine then needs ping
> with help fo module, ansible performs task
> can write your own module
> module is idempotent whereas linux commands might be or might not be idempotent

3. Variables
> name: letters,numbers,underscores
> name must start with a letter

4. Facts
> information about nodes
> whenver control machine pushes changes to nodes control machine would gather information of nodes
 like, package is installec or not, amount of hardware,network information,etc  
  
5. Plays and Playbook
> Playbook: instruction manual/ series of tasks to be done in proper sequence
> playbook: consist of plays
> Each play--module/some task
> playbook: written in YAML

6. Configuration files
> default configuration file: /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
> ansible look for details to execute jobs from ansible configuration file

7. Templates
> for file--combination of static and dynamic contents
> to change content of such file--template
e.g, welcome to <machine name>

8. Handler and roles
> Handler--pre-defined actions to be performed after certain tasks
  say, whenver you make changes in ssh configuration files, needs to restart ssh service
  here ssh service restart task can be done through handler 

9. Ansible Vault
> secure store--keep sensitive data
> encrypted files
