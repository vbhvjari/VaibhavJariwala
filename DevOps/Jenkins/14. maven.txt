Maven Repository


Without Jenkins:
> settings.xml under.m2 directory
> mvn deploy
> Disadvange: upload artifact--all successsful build-
  evcen uplaod half successful build
  say, one project having 5 sub projects..first 3 successful, last 2 failed
  here, upload for first 3 successful build, not for last 2 builds



With Jenkins
> through plugin
> Advantage: upload artifact--only for successful build
only upload when complete build is successful
only uplaod when all 5 sub project build are successful
