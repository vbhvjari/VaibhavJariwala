Build Lifecycle:

1. compile	mvn compile
2. testing	mvn test
3. packaging	mvn package
4. deploy	mvn deploy

default behaviour :
say you execute, mvn package then mvn compile and mvn test would be done first automatically(;revious phases run automatically)--everytime


phases:

validate :	check everything in place; say pom.xml exists										mvn validate
compile : 	compilation: source  code(java files) to class files-target directory will be created--class files stored under target	mvn compile
test : 		testing--fech from src/main/test											mvn test
package: 	mltiple files into single file---stored in target folder								mvn package
install:	copy artifact to local maven repository--publish artifact to local repository(M2_HOME)					mvn install
deploy:		publish artifact to remote repository											mvn deploy

clean: 		clean workspace created by previous build; removes target folder							mvn clean



dependencies: downloaded from maven online repository and get stored in local repository(M2_HOME)
