dependencies: downloaded from maven online repository and get stored in local repository(M2_HOME)

only need to mention primary dependencies in pom.xml file
relatives dependencies would be taken care by maven

mvn clean	removes target folder--removes class files,artifacts

say, you have mentioned some framework and related framework jar is not present 
mention dependency details in pom.xml in dependency section 
so maven will connect to online repository and will download dependency automatically


How to get dependency details(groupId, artifactId, version)
google > maven repository or sonatype

mvn compile
> download dependency to target folder
> then maven locally compile code


scope
> default scope: compile
  <scope>compile</scope>	jar/dependency would be available at compile phase
