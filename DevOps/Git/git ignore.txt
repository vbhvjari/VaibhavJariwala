git ignore

> ignore files from commit
> say, some local configuration files/residue files which are not supposed to commit to repository


Steps:
Say, we want to exclude files having .tmp extension, not to be traced by git

1. navigate to local respository(where .git directory resides)
   pwd
   /home/scrapbook/tutorial


2. add pattern to .gitignore file
   echo '*.tmp' > .gitignore
 
   [muliple patterns can be added;echo '*.txt' >> .gitignore ]



3. add changes to staging/commit
   git add -A
   git commit -m "added .gitignore"

4. Now create some files having .tmp extensions..
   touch test.tmp

5. Check status
   git status


Here, test.tmp will not be traced by git

Note:
> say, laptop.txt file created before creating .gitignore and if you add .txt in .gitignore, it would also work..
