Version control system(VCS)

> keeps track of changes 
> keeps track of who made changes with timestamp
> restore previous version if needed
> automatic merge

> 2 types:
  1. CVCS : Centralized Version Control System
  2. DVCS : Distributed Version Control System

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. CVCS : Centralized Version Control System

> Client-Server Architecture
> Centralized repository at server end
> Client nodes - connect to centralized repository
> data from repository to client nodes : pull	download
  data from client nodes to repository : push	upload
> Limitation: no HA, no redundancy
  Complete failure if server goes down
> e.g., SVN,ClearCase,TFS(VSS)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. DVCS : Distributed Version Control System

> no server/client concept
  any node can become client or server

> we can keep copy of repository at each node   

> Advantages:
  - no chance of failure as respository at every node
  - performance enhancement
    (say,server and client nodes location are geographically very far;latency issue)

> e.g., Git
