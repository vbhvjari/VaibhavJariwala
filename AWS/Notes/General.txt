Regions
> Each region is a separate geographic area and is completely independent
> Communication between regions is across the public Internet
> Data transfer between regions is charged at the Internet data transfer rate for both the sending and the receiving instance
> Resources aren’t replicated across regions unless done explicitly

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Availability Zones
> Each AZ is physically isolated from each other
> AZs in a region are connected with low-latency private links and not through public internet

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IAM
> Fee to use-IAM is offered at no additional charge and charges are applied only for use of other AWS products by your IAM users.
> Free STS service- IAM provide STS which is an included feature of the AWS account offered at no additional charge.
 	            AWS charges only for the use of other AWS services accessed by the AWS STS temporary security credentials.

> Root Credentials has full unrestricted access to AWS account including the account security credentials which include sensitive information
> An Administrator account can be created for all the activities which too has full access to the AWS account except the accounts security credentials, billing     information and ability to change password
> Each IAM user is associated with one and only one AWS account. 
> IAM User cannot be renamed from AWS management console and has to be done from CLI or SDK tools.
> IAM Best Practice – Enable MFA on Root accounts and privilege users
> MFA needs to enabled on the Root user and IAM user separately as they are distinct entities. Enabling MFA on Root does not enable it for all other users



> IAM role is not intended to be uniquely associated with a particular user, group or service and is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.
> Role does not have any credentials (password or access keys) associated with it and whoever assumes the role is provided with a dynamic temporary credentials
