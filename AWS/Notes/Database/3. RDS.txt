RDS: Relational Database Service

> zonal
> Relational database(SQL; data-structured;RDBMS)
> Auto scaling: not possible (unlike in EC2)

> shell (root ssh) access to DB instances is not provided
> RDS instance connect through endpoint(DNS)

> Each DB instance: storage- 5 GB to 6 TB
> DB instance- DB instance identifier- unique in a region
> one DB instance- multiple databases


> Multi-AZ: redundancy/High Availability
  Read-Replica: performance

> AWS
  - automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica of the DB instance in a different AZ
  - Primary DB instance is synchronously replicated across AZs to the standby replica
  - Provides data redundancy, failover support, eliminate I/O freezes, and minimize latency spikes during system backups

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RDS supported Engines:  1. MSSQL(Microsoft SQL Server)- only windows
			2. MySQL- windows,unix, linux
			3. MariaDB- linux
			4. Oracle
			5. PostgreSQL
			6. Amazon Aurora: MySQL/PostgreSQL client; upto 64 TB; cheaper than oracle; 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Backup: automated and manual

> creates a storage volume snapshot of the DB instance, backing up the entire DB instance and not just individual databases.
> Multi-AZ DB deployments, there is No I/O suspension since the backup is taken from the standby instance


> enabled by default
> backup data stored in S3
  backup data sotrage is free
  e.g., database 10 GB, backup data store in S3- 100 GB , storage free for backup data

> data replication from primary to backup - taken care by aws; free

Automated
> Backup retention period: 0 to 35 days; default: 7 days
> 1st full backup(just like golden image); once in a day
  After full backup, transistion logs; stored in S3

> Say, full backup is taken everyday at 5 AM
  last transaction log backup was taken at 8:30 AM
  
  If DB goes down, we can restore
  1st create RDS from full backup(5 AM) and then from latest transaction logs

> Automated DB snapshots are deleted when
  - the retention period expires
  - the automated DB snapshots for a DB instance is disabled
  - the DB instance is deleted

> When a DB instance is deleted
  - a final DB snapshot can be created upon deletion; which can be used to restore the deleted DB instance at a later date
  - RDS retains the final user-created DB snapshot along with all other manually created DB snapshots
  - all automated backups are deleted and cannot be recovered

> Disabling automated backups will disable the point-in-time recovery
> Changes to the backup window take effect immediately


Manual Backup(DB snapshot)

> RDS keeps all manual DB snapshots until explicitly deleted
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multi-AZ: across AZs, not across regions 

> High availability
> not scaling solution
> synchronous replication
> Primary instance
> Standby instance- replica of primary instance; in diff AZ than of primay instance
> Automatic failover and manual failover(reboot with failover-forced failover)
> Automatic failover
  - Planned database maintenance
  - Software patching
  - Rebooting of the Primary instance
  - Primary DB instance connectivity or host failure
  - Availability Zone failure

> replication-taken care by aws
> can be used for Disaster Recovery(DR)

> When running primary DB Instance as a Multi-AZ deployment, we can not use the standby for read or write operations
  At a time, only one type of instance(either primary or standby) would be in work mode

> Standby replica: no read or no write when primary instace is in use

> Multi-AZ : primary instance is synchronously replicated across Availability Zones to a standby replica to provide
  - data redundancy
  - eliminate I/O freezes during snapshots and backups
  - minimize latency spikes during system backups

> Multi-AZ uses snapshot for primary to standy and vice a versa replication

> Failover mechanism automatically changes the DNS record (CNAME) of the DB instance to point to the standby DB instance

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Read-Replica: across AZ, ,across regions

> Performance enhancement by providing read query from replica instance; only read queries, not write queries
> used for scaling/performance improvement
> not for DR
> for very heavy database

> Asynchronous replication
> Load on the source DB instance can be reduced by routing read queries from the applications to the Read Replica 
> Max read replica of source DB instance: 5
> Prerequisites: Automated backup with retention period above 0 days

> RDS sets up a secure communications channel between the source DB instance and the Read Replica, 
  if that Read Replica is in a different AWS region from the DB instance.

> If the source DB instance is deleted without deleting the replicas, each replica is promoted to a stand-alone, single-AZ DB instance.

> If the source instance of a Multi-AZ deployment fails over to the standby, 
  any associated Read Replicas are switched to use the secondary as their replication source

> MyDBInstance replicates to ReadReplica1, ReadReplica1 can’t be configured to replicate back to MyDBInstance.  
  From ReadReplica1, only a new Read Replica can be created, such as ReadRep2

> Read Replicas require a transactional storage engine and are only supported for the InnoDB storage engine

> endpoint of read-replica is different than of primary instance 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comparison

Multi-AZ							Read Replicas

> Synchronous replication – highly durable			> Asynchronous replication – highly scalable
> Only database engine on primary instance is active		> All read replicas are accessible and can be used for read scaling
> Automated backups are taken from standby			> No backups configured by default
> Always span two Availability Zones within a single Region	> Can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region
> Database engine version upgrades happen on primary		> Database engine version upgrade is independent from source instance
> Automatic failover to standby when a problem is detected	> Can be manually promoted to a standalone database instance

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Storage

> DB: EBS storage- SSD general purpose; SSD provisioned, magnetic
> Storage can be increased; but can not be decreased
> provisioned IOPS will be preferred for batch oriented workload.
> by default, max RDS size: 16 TB

> In general, for database: provisoned IOPS EBS
> If mentioned, infrequent read/write with small perks : general purpose IOPS EBS

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Encryption- KMS
Enable encryption for Non encrepted DB instance
> take manual backup(DB snapshot)
> Copy snapshot; enable encryption

> All instnace may not support DB encryption
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon Aurora

> Fully managed relational database

> MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible
  Aurora MySQL:      5x performance of MySQL without requiring any changes to most MySQL applications
  Aurora PostgreSQL: 3x performance of PostgreSQL

> start with 10 GB
  scale up in increment of 10 GB
  Database size upto 64 TB

> Cheaper than oracle

> Replicate database in 6 copies in 3 AZs in single region(2 copies in each AZ)
> Divides database in chunks 10 GB; each 10 GB chunk is replicated in 6 copies in 3 AZs in a region

> Aurora is designed to transparently handle 
  - the loss of up to two copies of data without affecting database write availability 
  - up to three copies without affecting read availability

> joins/queries to be performed easily

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Encryption of RDS database at rest

>  Use the Encryption feature for RDS at database creation time

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Free tier- 

> single-AZ only
> 750 hours per month
> 20 GB of General Purpose (SSD) database storage
> 20 GB of backup storage
