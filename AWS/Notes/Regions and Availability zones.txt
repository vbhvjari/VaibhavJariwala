Regions
> Each region is a separate geographic area and is completely independent
> Communication between regions is across the public Internet
> Data transfer between regions is charged at the Internet data transfer rate for both the sending and the receiving instance
> Resources aren’t replicated across regions unless done explicitly

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Availability Zones
> Each AZ is physically isolated from each other
> AZs in a region are connected with low-latency private links and not through public internet
> names of AZs are randomly applied, so "us-east-1a" is not necessarily the same physical location of all three accounts

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> If it is asked to maintain lowest latency with redundancy, do not go with cross-region
  because, there will be some latency from one region to another
  go with multi AZ

> Whenever there is mentioned Disasters/Disaster recovery/DR-- always consider region specific 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resiliet 
> ability to recover/withstand quixkly from difficult situation
