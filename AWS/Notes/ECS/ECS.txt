ECS: Elastic Container Service

> AWS container management service
> regional service

> Docker Images are stored in 
  - Registry
  - Docker Hub
  - AWS ECR(Elastic Container Registry)


ECS launch type:
1. FARGATE : minimal/no need to manage underlying infra
2. EC2 : needs to manage underlying infra

Task
JSON files that describe containers information which forms your application
- which docker images to use with containers
- How much CPU/Memory to use with each container
- whether containers are linked together in task
- the command the container should run when it is started
- launch type: EC2 or FARGATE
> docker networking mode


ECS Clusters

> Logical group of container instances  
> By default, in ECS, cluster is created automatically
> cluster can contain multiple different container instances type
> clusters are region specific
> Container instances can only be part of one cluster at a time
> IAM policies can be created to allow/restrict users access to specific clusters


ECS Scheduling

1. Service Scheduler
> ensures that specified number of tasks are constantly running and reschedules task when task fails
> can ensure tasks are registered against an ELB

2. Custom Scheduler
> custom scheduler can be created to meet business needs



ECS Container Agent

> allows container instances to connect to cluster
> not works with windows
> To set ECS container agent, set configuration in user data patameter of ECS instance


ECS Features
- Task Definition
- Tasks
- Cluster


> Customers have control over AWS ECS instances

> container instances need external network access to communicate with AWS ECS service endpoints
  - through public IP 
  - through NAT Gateway  
  - VPC endpoints

> if container instance does not have public IP, then it must have NAT gateway
> audit purpose: use CloudTrail logs
