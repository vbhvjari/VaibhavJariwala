AD-FS: Active Directory Federation

> Say, you have existing AD in on premise DC and you have AD users
> To allow same on premise AD users to login to AWS account, ADFS is used
> With ADFS, on premise AD users are allowed to login to AWS account directly instead of creating IAM users in AWS. 
> For that, we need to create roles in IAM.

Move entire AD to AWS

> Say, we have AD setup in on premise DC
> we want to migrate entire AD to AWS then there are 2 ways:

   1. Configure Domain Controller on EC2
   > Here, on premise DC to AWS replication to be taken care by customer, not by AWS

   2. AWS services:  Directory Service
     -  AWS managed Microsoft AD
     - Simple AD
     - AD Connector
     - Amazon cognito User pools
