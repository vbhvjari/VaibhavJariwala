> Say, we want to deploy java application, Elastic Beanstalk will configure EC2,ELB,ASG and all necessary backend process and deploy java application.
   User do not need to build underlying infra setup manually. AWS will do it automatically.

> It provides diff deplyment stratergies:
    1. Rolling updates
    > code wil be tested only in 1 server and then will be deployed in all other servers

     2. Green-Blue Deployment
     > testing is done on separate infra and then will be deployed in prod
 
     3. immutable
     > keeping existing infra as it is, build new infra and scapping existing infra step by step
