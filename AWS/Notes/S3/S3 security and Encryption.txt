Encryption

1. Transit
   SSL/TLS

2. At Rest
   server side encryption(SSE)- S3 managed keys-SSE-S3(default), SSE-KMS, with customer provided key SSE-C
 
   client side encryption

server-side encryption is about data encryption at rest   
S3 encrypts your data at the object level as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it.

As long as you authenticate your request and you have access permissions, there is no difference in the way you access encrypted or unencrypted objects.


SSE-S3 requires that Amazon S3 manages the data and master encryption keys.
SSE-C requires that you manage the encryption keys
SSE-KMS requires that AWS manages the data key but you manage the master key in AWS KMS
