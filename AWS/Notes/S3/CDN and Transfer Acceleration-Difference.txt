ClouFront CDN - Content Delivery Network

> Creating CloudFront distribution with origin pointing to S3 bucket, 
  "caching at edge locations" will be enabled

> Consequences requests to the same objects will be served through the Edge location(cache) 
  which is faster for the end user and also reduces the load on your origin(S3 bucket)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transfer Acceleration

> Enabling Transfer Acceleration for S3 bucket, data trasfers(GET/PUT from/to S3) are performed via same edge locations
  but no caching would be on Edge locations.

> Here, Network path is optimized for long-distance large-object uploads. Hence, higher throughput can be achieved

If it is mentioned to choose cost effective way then go with CDN
