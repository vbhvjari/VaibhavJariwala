> AWS service that allows to connect on premise storage with AWS cloud storage
> virtual appliance to be installed in on premise DC
> supports Hyper-V and VMWare ESXi
> Types:
  1. File Gateway(NFS) - flat files(pdf,images,word,excel files,not OS/DB files); stores directly on S3

  2. Volumes Gateway(iSCSI) - OS files- block storage - EBS snapshots in AWS; incremental snapshots
     > stored volumes -entire volume
     > cached volumes - only frequently used volume data

  3. Tape Gateway(VTL-Virtual Tape Library) - backup and archival; virtual tape  
                                              NetBackup, Backp Exec, Veeam, etc..

> Use case:
  Say, you have existing on premise DC and want to move to cloud.
  There aee some application running, that needs traditional on premise hardware only
  for such legacy applications, storage gateway is useful.

+++++++++++++++++
1. Stored volume gateway
> primary data is stored locally 
> entire dataset is available for low latency access while aysnchronously backed up to S3
> low latency to all data :  stored volumes gateway


2. Cached volume gateway
> data stored in S3 and retain a copy of frequently accessed data subnets locally
> we are not storing backups on S3 but the actual primary data itself
> extend on-premise storage to AWS
  easy extension of on-premise  to AWS
