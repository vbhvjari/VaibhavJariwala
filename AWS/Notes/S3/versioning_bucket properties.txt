> default version ID for non versioning bucket: null
> versioning is applicable only for new objects
> It is property of bucket and if enabled to a bucket, versioning is applicable to all objects within a bucket
> DELETE API call on the object does not delete the actual object; but places delte-marker on the object

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages of versioning:

> keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket
  e.g., index.html file would be changed frequently and you want to keep track of changes done

> can restore deleted file using delete-marker
  useful in accidential delete
   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
