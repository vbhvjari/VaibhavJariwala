> Pre-sgined URL allows user to be able to download/upload a specific object without requiring AWS security credentials or permissions
> Pre-signed URL allows anyone access to the object identified in the URL, provided the creator of the URL has permissions to access that object
> Creation of the pre-signed urls requires the creator to provide his security credentials, 
  specify a bucket name, an object key, an HTTP method (GET for download object & PUT of uploading objects), and expiration date and time
> Pre-signed urls are valid only till the expiration date & time
