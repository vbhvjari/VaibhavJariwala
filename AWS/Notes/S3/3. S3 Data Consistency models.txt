PUT : upload file to AWS S3
GET: retrieve/request file from AWS S3
DELETE: delete file from AWS S3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Read After Write Consistency	PUTs

> If you upload the file, it would be available and able to be accessed immediately
> Basically, it would be newly PUTs objects

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Eventual consistency

> When you make some changes in existing objects or delete objects, it will take time to propagate changes
  because AWS keeps 6 copies of each object, spanning in multiple AZs. So it will take some time(in ms or seconds) to reflect changes
> Basically it would be overwrites PUTs and DELETEs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only for Information:

> strong consistency
  A successful response to a PUT reuest for new object only occurs when the object is completely saved

> S3 does not provide strong consistency
