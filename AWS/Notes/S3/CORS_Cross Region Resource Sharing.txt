CORS: Cross Origin Resource Sharing


> CORS defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. 
> All browsers implement the Same-Origin policy, for security reasons, where the web page from an domain can only request resources from the same domain
> CORS allow client web applications loaded in one domain access to the restricted resources to be requested from another domain
