object storage
> way of organizing data
> object has globally unique identifier: able to access object(data) without knowing its location in disk
> metadata; very useful in identification

limitations:
> dont allow to edit one part of file(data); must be manipulated/operated as a whole unit


block storage
> entire data is split into predefined size of block of data
> no metadata; blocks are identified by its SCSI address
> must be attached to OS
