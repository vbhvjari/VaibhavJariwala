> Replicate objects from one bucket to another
> buckets should be in diff regions
  source bucket in one region in a AWS account; destination bucket in diff region in same AWS account or can be in a region of diff AWS account

> Versioning must be enabled in source bucket and destination bucket both

> Replication doesn't work for existing objects

> To replicate existing objects, make changes in metadata of objects
 

> Create two buckets ; each in diff region
> S3 > source bucket > Management > Replication > Add rule
  Create new role



> To replicate existing objects manually,
  Must be manually copied from source bucket to destination bucket through CLI
  
  > Create AWS programmatic user
  > configure it
  > Command: aws s3 cp --recursive s3://<source_bucket_name> s3://<destination_bucket_name>
    Example: aws s3 cp --recursive s3://source-bucket-march s3://destination-bucket-replication

> Now check destination bucket. objects of source buckets are copied to destination bucket

> When you upload new files(objects) or make any changes in existing objects, same will be reflected in destination bucket automatically
> But if you delete object or for delete-marker, same will not be reflected in destination bucket for better security provision
