Network ACLs

> Stateless firewall
> Firewall for Subnets
> supports both Allow and Deny rules
  e.g, deny specific IP to EC2 instance

> Rules are applied in their order; rule with lower number gets processed first
  
  Rule(Order number)	Type	 		Protocol	Port Range	Source			Allow/Deny
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  100			HTTP (80)		TCP (6)	 	80		0.0.0.0/0		ALLOW
  200			HTTPS (443)		TCP (6)	  	443		0.0.0.0/0		ALLOW

> Default NACL: By default, allow everything for inbound, allow everything for outbound
  custom NACL: By default, deny everything for inbound, deny everything for outbound

> each and every subnet must associate with NACL
  if subnet is not associated with NACL explicitely, it gets automatically associated with default NACL

> Same NACL can be associated with multiple subnets
  But same subnet can be associated with only one NACL
