Cross-zone balancing

> By default, the load balancer distributes incoming requests evenly across its enabled Availability Zones 
  for e.g. If AZ-a has 5 instances and AZ-b has 2 instances, the load will still be distributed 50% across each of the AZs

> Enabling Cross-Zone load balancing allows the ELB to distribute incoming requests evenly across all the back-end instances, 
  regardless of the AZ, Cross-zone load balancer reduces the need to maintain equivalent 

> If cross-zone balancing is enabled,
  each load balancer node for your Classic Load Balancer distributes requests evenly across the registered instances in all enabled Availability Zones.

> If cross-zone load balancing is disabled, 
  each load balancer node distributes requests evenly across the registered instances in its Availability Zone only.

> Cross-zone load balancing reduces the need to maintain equivalent numbers of instances in each enabled Availability Zone,
  and improves your application's ability to handle the loss of one or more instances.
