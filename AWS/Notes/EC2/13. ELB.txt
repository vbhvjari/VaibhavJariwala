ELB- Elastic Load Balancer

> Load balancing service
> ELB: regional 
> 3 types: 
  1. CLB: Classic Load Balancer
  2. ALB: Application Load Balancer
  3. NLB: Network Load Balancer

> Say, there are 2 EC2 instances under ELB; each EC2 instance runs 3 DBs
  internet load balancer: load balancing from ELB to EC2 instances: through public IP	internet	
  internal load balancer: load balancing among DBs within a EC2: through private IP	within VPC

> No public IP of ELB available, only DNS name of ELB available
  whenever we launch ELB, ELB will create a node in each subnet

> ELB service will not consume IP,but consume DNS
   only ELB nodes will consume IP

> instances monitored by ELB are reported as InService or OutofService

CLB

> Error: 504 Gateway timeout

> X-Forwarded-For header
  when we need to fetch info(IP address-IPv4) of end user
  need of public IP address of end user

Listener Configuration

Protocol: 
> HTTP/HTTPs
> SSL
> TCP	custom port

Load Balancer Port
> load balacing through which protocol/port

Instance Port
> depends on application running in EC2
  e.g., apache: 80
        tomcat: 8080
	MySQL:  3306

Cross-Zone Load Balancing	distributes traffic evenly across all targets 
Connection Draining		no of seconds allow existing traffic to continue flowing 
				no of seconds ELB waits before transffering traffic to another node in ELB


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
ALB

> for HTTP/HTTPs 
>  ALB : route/distribute traffic based on path
> for containers, route traffic based on ports

> routing among paths
  specific requests to specific paths or servers



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
NLB

> extreme network performance
> works at OSI layer-4
