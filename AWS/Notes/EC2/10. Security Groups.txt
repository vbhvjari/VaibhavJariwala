> One instance can have multiple firewall rules means can have multiple security groups

> 1. Inbound rules: From outside to AWS network 
  2. Outbound rules: From AWS network to outside 

> Making changes in security groups, reflect immediately

> security group: stateful
  even if we delete outbound rule, if we allow http in inbound, it gets automatically allow outbound rule 
  
  ACL: stateless
  
1. Inbound rules

> From outside to AWS network 
  e.g., from internet to aws ec2

> Allows all inbound traffic from other instances associated with the default security group 
  (the security group specifies itself as a source security group in its inbound rules)
  By default, only allow traffic from instances in same subnet/security group

2. Outbound rules:

> From AWS network to outside
> By default, allows everything
  Allows all outbound traffic from the instance.

> can add or remove inbound and outbound rules for any default security group. 
> can't delete a default security group
