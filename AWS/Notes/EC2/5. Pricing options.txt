EC2 pricing

> pay only for you use
> pricing per hour or per seconds(minimum 60 seconds)
> billing only for "running" instance
> no charge for "stop" , "hibernate" , "terminate" instance

> Here,even if EC2 instance is in stopped/hibernated state,
  billing applicable for attached EBS volume
  billing applicable for EIP if attached to the instance

1. Shared- Your EC2 instance which hosted on host machine, other EC2 instance owned by other AWS accounts would be hosted in same host machine 
2. Dedicated -host machine will be dedicated and only host your EC2 instances

3 ways
1. On-Demand
2. Reserved
3. Spot

Shared

1. On demand

> Pay per hour basis
> you will get instance anytime
> Generally, used for testing, learning purposes 
> Persistent until you terminate instance

> Well suited for
  - testing/non prod
  - no long term commitmnet
  - applications with short term or unpredictable work load
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Reserved

> Reserve instance for longer/specific time duration
> Cheaper 30-70% than on demand
> Recommended to  use reserved instance in prod environment
> payment not refundable
> cannot be moved from one region to another
> Auto scaling can be done

> Well suited for
  - applications with predictable usage
  - applications that requires reserved capacity 

> Persistent

  1. Fully Upfront: reserve instance; full payment in the beginning regardless of usage
  2. Partially Upfront: reserve instance; some portion of payment in the beginning; remianing: as per hourly basis on discount rate, regardless of its usage
  3. No Upfront: no payment in the beginning; charge: as per hourly basis on discount rate, regardless of its usage
                 1 year reservation

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Spot
> Not persistent; no commitment 
> available as per bid
> If someone else bids higher than yours, your instance will be terminated immediately(with grace time: 2 min)
  warning 2 min before terminating instance
> Very very cheaper
> mainly used for data processing/analysing for shorter time; batch processing
> Use cases: non-consistent heavy compute at cheaper rate 
  In such cases, where large amount of CPU/memory is needed for short duration and no important data to be stored on instance
  Where instance would be needed as secondary 
  E.g., data processing,data mining, big data

Scheduled Instance

> instance is reserved for predefined time duration
> 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:
> Say, you have subscribed for reserved instance(RI). RI is going to be expired after 15 days. 
  If you do not renew subscription, then RI will get automatically converted from reserved to on demand instance.
