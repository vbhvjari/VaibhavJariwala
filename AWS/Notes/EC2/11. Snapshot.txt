> snapshot of EBS volume
> snapshot: regional
> snapshot stored in S3; but not visible under S3
> can be created volume from snapshot
  (make sure that volume is created in same AZ as in EC2)

> snapshot is recovery point

> snapshot: incremental
  e.g., snapshot-1: full copy: 100 GB
        snapshot-2: incremental: data changed of 1 GB
  	snapshot-3: incremental: data changed of 1 GB
	snapshot-4: incremental: data changed of 2 GB
  
   At this point of time, user needs to pay only for latest snapshot(snapshot-4; only for 2 GB instead of 100 GB)
   AWS will manage and store full backup in such case

> Use cases:
  - It can be used as backup/restore
  - Data migration between instances
  - data replication from one AZ to another
  - DR (snapshot can be copied from one region to another)

> snapshot of encrypted volume: encrypted automatically
> restoration from encryted snapshot: encrypted volumes
> snapshot sharing : only possible for unencrypted snapshots
  snapshot public or can be shared to other AWS accounts

> To take consistent snapshot, it is best practice to shut down instance before taking snapshot

unencrypted voume to encrypted volume
> create snapshot from unencrypted volume (here, snapshot will also be unencrypted only)
> create volume from snapshot, here you can select encrypted and newly created volume will be encrypted

snapshot of RAID volumes

> snapshot excludes data held in the cache by application and OS
> To take snapshot of RAID volumes, pick any one of following options:
  - stop application from writing to disk
  - fluash all caches to disk
      > frreze file system
      > unmount RAID array
      > shut down EC2 instance

EBS snapshot
> create image from snapshot - posible
> create EBS volume from snapshot - possible
> share snapshot to another AWS account - possible
> make unencrypted copy of an encrypted snapshot - not possible

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
you cannot remove/disable encryption from encrypted snapshot

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that, snapshot from unencrypted EBS would be unencrypted one
	   snapshot from encrypted EBS would be encrypted one
