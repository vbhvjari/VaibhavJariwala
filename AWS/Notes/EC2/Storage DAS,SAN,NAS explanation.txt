DAS: Direct Attached Storage
SAN: Storage Area Network
NAS: Network Attached Storage

DAS
> Say, three persons A,B,C. each one owns laptop and HDD size is 100 GB.
> A can use hard disk attached to his laptp only. A cannot use disk attached to laptop of B or C.
> In a same way, B and C can use disks attached to their respective laptops only.
> This is DAS
> In short, DAS is local and cannot be shared among people/system.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAN
> Now we make some arrangement that disks owned by each user can be logically treated as one storage pool
> Now, as per user requirement, we can share storage from storage pool to users.
  Say, A needs 50 GB, B needs 10 GB, C needs 30 GB.
  We can allocate requested storage to concern users
> Say, same storage 10 GB is shared among users A,B,C.
  Now, all 3 users have access of same storage 10 GB.
  Here, shared storage is mounted and visible to other users. 
  But only one user/system can access shared storage at a time.
> Here, 10 GB shared storage is assigned to 3 users.
  say we setup NFS server in node A and created NFS share on node A. 
  now, we share NFS share to node B and C.
  If node A is down or NFS share is not accessible, node B and C are not able to use shared storage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAS
> NAS provides shared storage and that shared storage can be accessed simultaneously by multiple users at a time.
> It means that say, 10 GB shared storage is assigned to 3 users A,B,C. 
  This shared storage is mounted and visible to all 3 users.
  Also multiple users/systems can access shared storage at a time simultaneously.
> NAS overcomes limitation of SAN that is
  even if any node is down, we can still access shared storage.
  Becase, storage is shared from NAS.
