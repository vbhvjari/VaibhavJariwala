EBS Optimized Instance

> provides dedicated network throughput between EC2 instances and EBS volumes
  additional and dedicated capacity for I/O
  dedicated bandwidth

> EBS-optimized instances enable EC2 instances to fully use the IOPS provisioned on an EBS volume
  For data transfer it will not use  the same network card that it uses for Network conmmunication 

> not all instances types are EBS optimized

> You can not modify for running instance. Need to stop and upgrade the instance type which support EBS optimized
