Increase ssh server/client timeout

By sending null packet between client and server at a specified interval that is smaller than the timeout value, SSH timeout can be avoided.


TCPKeepAlive

System sends TCP alive message (not encrypted) to connecting clients to test connection issues.

If they are sent, death of the connection or
             crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed.  However,
             this means that connections will die if the route is down tem-
             porarily, and some people find it annoying.  On the other hand,
             if TCP keepalives are not sent, sessions may hang indefinitely on
             the server, leaving “ghost” users and consuming server resources.

             The default is “yes” (to send TCP keepalive messages), and the
             server will notice if the network goes down or the client host
             crashes.  This avoids infinitely hanging sessions.

             To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to
             “no”.

Default value:yes


At server end

ClientAliveInterval 
Server sends null packets (encrypted) to client every <> seconds if no data has been received from client
until client have ween active for <> intervals
Default value:0
number of seconds that the server will wait before sending a null packet to the client (to keep the connection alive).


ClientAliveCountMax
Number of times, server sends null packets (encrypted) to client if no communication between client and server.
Default value:3




Example: 
ClientAliveInterval 120
ClientAliveCountMax 720

Server will send null packets to client every 120 seconds and not disconnect them until client have been inactive for 720 intervals (120 seconds * 720 = 24 hours). It means that if there is no communication between client and server, connection will be disconnected after 2 hours.


At client end [do not have server access]


ServerAliveInterval	(encrypted)
number of seconds that the client will wait before sending a null packet to the server (to keep the connection alive).


ServerAliveCountMax	(encrypted)
